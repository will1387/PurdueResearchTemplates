# PurdueResearchTemplates
Template Websites that the rest of the team implemented for research purposes
Due to changing requirements, the starting page is not index.html, but login.html
I was added to the team near the end, so this website was designed out of deadline necessesity instead of security.
Database was added after my portion of code was created.
